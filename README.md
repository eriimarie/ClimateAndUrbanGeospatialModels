## Geospatial Models Q&A

### **Project 1: Geospatial Analysis of Taxi Trips in Porto**
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Folium, Matplotlib
- **Summary:**  
  Analyzed taxi trip data from Porto, Portugal, focusing on dispatch methods, demand, and regional pickup hotspots.  
  Explored common taxi hailing methods and city zones with highest activity.  
  Created visualizations including bar charts and mapped taxi routes.

### **Project 2: Climate Geospatial Analysis with Python X-Array**
- **Tools Used:** Python, XArray, NETCDF, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Summary:**  
  Performed climate data analysis using NETCDF datasets spanning 1980â€“2020.  
  Visualized skin temperature, leaf area index, and temporal climate variations.  
  Heat maps and line plots illustrate geographic and temporal trends tied to climate change.
