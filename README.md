Geospatial Models Q and A
Description: 
  - Project 1: Geospatial Analysis of Taxi Trips in Porto
In this project, I analyzed taxi trip data from Porto, Portugal, using Python and Folium. The dataset includes columns such as trip dispatch,
 demand, and various other trip-related details. By breaking down the data, I explored questions like the
most common ways to hail a taxi in Porto and the best regions of the city for pick-up points. Visualizations include bar graphs and mapped routes,
offering insights into taxi usage patterns and popular areas across the city.
-Project 2: Climate Geospatial Analysis with Python X-Array (NETCDF Dataset)
This project involves climate data analysis using NETCDF datasets in Python, specifically leveraging X-Array to examine multiple
geospatial variables like longitude, latitude, time, and EXPVER. The analysis includes visualizations of skin temperature, leaf area index, and
temperature variations over time, using heat maps and line graphs to depict patterns. The dataset spans from the 1980s to 2020, offering insights
into climate change through temperature and geospatial analysis,
visualized across different time periods and geographical zones.
